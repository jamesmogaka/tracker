        The "Sign In" box is tailored for existing members who have already registered with Friends of Ngong Hills. It facilitates quick and secure access to their accounts, allowing them to resume interactions, engage in ongoing conversations, and explore community events seamlessly.
        Members entering the platform through the "Sign In" option are prompted to enter their credentials, typically a combination of their registered email address or username and the associated password. This verification process ensures the security of their accounts.
