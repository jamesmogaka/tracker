        The "Sign In" box is tailored for existing members who have already registered with Friends of Ngong Hills. It facilitates quick and secure access to their accounts, allowing them to resume interactions, engage in ongoing conversations, and explore community events seamlessly.
        Members entering the platform through the "Sign In" option are prompted to enter their credentials, typically a combination of their registered email address or username and the associated password. This verification process ensures the security of their accounts.

        These boxes collectively embody our commitment to providing a user-centric environment, where the onboarding process is intuitive and access to the community is readily available. Whether users are newcomers eager to contribute to the Friends of Ngong Hills mission or existing members returning for continued engagement, the "Sign Up" and "Sign In" boxes serve as navigational tools, facilitating a positive and inclusive user experience.
